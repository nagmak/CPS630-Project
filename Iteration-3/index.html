                <h3>Taj Mahal, India</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

                <h3>Sydney Opera House, Australia</h3>
                <p>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre at Sydney Harbour in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.[3]
                    Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed up by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[4] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[5]</p>

                <h3>La Sagrada Familia, Spain</h3>
                <p>The Basílica de la Sagrada Família (Catalan: [bəˈzilikə ðə lə səˈɣɾaðə fəˈmiljə]; Spanish: Basílica de la Sagrada Familia; ('Basilica of the Holy Family')),[3] also known as the Sagrada Família, is a large unfinished Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Designed by Spanish/Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), his work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[4] On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.[5][6][7]
                    On 19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Família began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned,[4] Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.[8]

                <h3>New York City, USA</h3>
                <p>New York City (NYC), also known as the City of New York or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[11] and, with approximately 23 million people in its consolidated statistical area, one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[12] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[13] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.[14][15]
        Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is divided into five administrative boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.[16] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[17] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[18] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[19] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[20][21] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$2.0 trillion. If greater New York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[22] It is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[23]

                <h3>Nile River, Egypt</h3>
                <p>The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, and is the longest river in Africa and the disputed longest river in the world, as the Brazilian government says that the Amazon River is longer than the Nile. The Nile, which is about 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, is an "international" river as its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.
                    The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is considered to be the headwaters and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.
                    The northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese desert to Egypt, then ends in a large delta and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Egyptian civilization and Sudanese kingdoms have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan, and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along river banks.

            <div ng-if="readMoreItem === 'Macchu Picchu'">
                <h3>Macchu Picchu, Peru</h3>
                <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[10][11] It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.
                    Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.
                    Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.[14] By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.
                    Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.[16]

It's like you are taking the Taj with you quoted from one of the critics. Handling the most complex construction with the simple and basic tools is the main highlight of the mausoleum and the 4 minarets that has been erected. It is said that the minarets has been constructed slightly slanted outwards to get that optical illusion of seeing everything erect.
                        All together it's a marvel we should all put in effort to preserve...</p>

The musical events and performances are truly amazing and always there all around the year. Feel free to take photos of the house. In some areas around the Opera House, you are able to see the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We chose the Angus Steak which tasted great and was cooked very well. Great vibe and atmosphere.</p>

It provides very good overview for the history of the city architecture and the people working here are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended to visit. It is one of the must visit places in the city. This place has some very interesting items to see in the basement museum and the user experience is absolutely amazing. The narrative provided for the visitors are very informative and interesting. This museum is very comfortable and disabled friendly. I could only say good things about this church and highly recommend others to visit (specially good for architecture students). Cheers and wish this recommendation would be useful for others.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Undoubtedly, Sagrada stands out as the one of the must visit place of not just Barcelona but overall. This has been under construction for so long (and still is) and the architecture looks a real stunner. Such minute artistry, ambiance and maintenance is next to none. Queues are big, so it is advisable to book your tickets in advance. Spend quite a good amount of time here soaking in the architectural beauty.  The use of color, space and stone is breath taking.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Lucky us that week we've been to Cusco during our SAmerica trip. It was mostly sunny and cloudy, but no raindrops. I was very excited to finally get to see Machu Picchu, which was for a long time on my list. Jorge, our guide, did a spectacular job. He too all the time to show us around and tell us stories about every single stone we saw (at least it felt this way). We got him as a private guide and met him outside of the site, paid $80 for 2.5 hours with him. It was decent and he was worth the money. Most important, we saw Machu Picchu and enjoyed every single minute!</p>

                  <p class="card-text">I spend 10 days on board of M/V Ushuaia. The experience was wonderful. The ship is in very good condition, the staff is very professionnal and helpful. The food on board was good with a lot of varieties. I had a premier cabin with twin beds and a private bathroom, it was confortable and the bathroom was spacious. I choose that kind of ship because you can do landings more often and the transfert to the shore doesn't take long. I had a great experiece on board of the M/V Ushuaia and I recommend it if you are looking for an adventurous vacation in that white paradise.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">My daughter and I returned to Antarctica after three years to run the Antarctica Marathon on King George Island. It didn’t matter that I came almost last because I achieved my goal to finish. Suzanne set out to improve her previous Antarctica Marathon time which she did comfortably while winning the marathon at the same time. “Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!”
        
                    Our ship took us to various landings around Antarctica Peninsula where we encountered many penguins, whales and other wildlife while once again enjoying the magnificent and unique scenery dominated by ice and snow. This is really a once in a lifetime experience but we’ve now been privileged to see Antarctica together twice.</p>

        <h3>New York City, USA</h3>
        <p>New York City (NYC), also known as the City of New York or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[11] and, with approximately 23 million people in its consolidated statistical area, one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[12] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[13] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.[14][15]
Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is divided into five administrative boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.[16] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[17] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[18] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[19] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[20][21] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$2.0 trillion. If greater New York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[22] It is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[23]

          <p class="card-text">New York City, 24-7, the city that never sleeps, the big apple, my first visit to the city was in October 2019: it really is such a busy, vibrant place which you surely can't tell one about in the 5000 character limit or one review, it really is something you have to experience for yourself as I surely found out in my first visit to the States and a cool place to mark #3100 on my review ladder.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> I don't think there's another place in the world.  Amazing vibe and energy.  If you are creative and in the arts, this is the place.  Everywhere you look is muse.  Since I lived there for 2 years, I experienced this -- you cannot stay at home.  Life calls your name through the window and says, come outside!</p>

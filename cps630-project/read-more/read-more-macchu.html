        <h3>Macchu Picchu, Peru</h3>
        <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.[10][11] It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.
            Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438â€“1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.
            Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.[14] By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.
            Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.[16]

          <p class="card-text">Lucky us that week we've been to Cusco during our SAmerica trip. It was mostly sunny and cloudy, but no raindrops. I was very excited to finally get to see Machu Picchu, which was for a long time on my list. Jorge, our guide, did a spectacular job. He too all the time to show us around and tell us stories about every single stone we saw (at least it felt this way). We got him as a private guide and met him outside of the site, paid $80 for 2.5 hours with him. It was decent and he was worth the money. Most important, we saw Machu Picchu and enjoyed every single minute!</p>

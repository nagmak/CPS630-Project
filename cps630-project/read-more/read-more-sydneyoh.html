        <h3>Sydney Opera House, Australia</h3>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre at Sydney Harbour in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.[3]
            Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed up by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973[4] after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.[5]</p>

          <p class="card-text">This place is a wonderful architecture building, the details are very interesting,the location is an imagination especially in the night. In addition, there are many restaurants and bars for many kinds of food. The good thing is very close to multi type of transportation like a ferry and a bus . For a souvenir, there are many shops for different kinds of goods. My advice, you need whole day to do a good experience and unforgettable day for your life and in the end please don’t forget to take many photos for a perfect memorial and try to be happy and relax</p>

          <p class="card-text">The place is vibrant and appealing as there is a truly remarkable architectural monument to see with amazing views of the city. The musical events and performances are truly amazing and always there all around the year. Feel free to take photos of the house. In some areas around the Opera House, you are able to see the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We chose the Angus Steak which tasted great and was cooked very well. Great vibe and atmosphere.</p>
